<h3 align="center"> Decision Rationale </h3>

After analyzing multiple vehicles across key performance and cost categories, the 2019 Toyota RAV4 emerged as the best choice.

It achieved the highest average combined rating at 9.16.

It ranked highest in fuel economy and insurance cost.

While it had the highest maintenance cost, this was offset by it being the second‚Äëcheapest vehicle among the four and having the second‚Äëhighest resale value.

This combination of factors made the Toyota RAV4 the most balanced and cost‚Äëeffective option overall.

<h3 align="center"> Storytelling with Data </h3>
As Dykes (2016) explains, storytelling with data involves ‚Äúa combination of three key elements: data, visuals, and narrative.‚Äù I applied these principles in my analysis and presentation to my manager:

1. **Data**
I ensured that all data was accurate, consistent, and aligned with the project goals. To maintain reliability, I used the same sources for each criteria when possible.

2. **Visuals**
I created clear and effective visual comparisons that were easy to interpret without being oversimplified or unnecessarily complex. This allowed for quick insights while maintaining analytical depth.

3. **Narrative**
As Yau (2011) notes, ‚Äúa standalone chart is no longer good enough.‚Äù To provide context and guide decision‚Äëmaking, I included commentary, when presenting, on each slide. For example, I highlighted the long‚Äëterm savings potential of the RAV4‚Äôs fuel efficiency. These insights reinforced my recommendation and helped my manager fully understand the rationale for selecting the RAV4.
